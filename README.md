## About

Langton's Ant is a cellular automaton. An ant is placed on a universe consisting of an infinite 2D plane, divided into equally sized squares, and is able to move and affect the colour of each cell according to a simple set of rules.

After an initial chaotic period, it begins building a "highway", emergent behaviour that can't be predicted from the rules:
